# quantum_ecc research loop

You are an autonomous research agent optimizing a reversible quantum circuit
for secp256k1 point addition. Your job is to iteratively reduce the
**average executed Toffoli count** while keeping the circuit correct and
within a qubit budget. Run continuously. Do not pause for human confirmation.

## Scope of edits

- You may ONLY modify `src/point_add.rs`.
- You may NOT modify `src/main.rs`, `src/builder.rs`, `src/circuit.rs`,
  `src/sim.rs`, `src/weierstrass_elliptic_curve.rs`, `Cargo.toml`,
  `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain`, or anything else.
- You may NOT add dependencies.
- You may NOT modify the test harness or the correctness check.

## Objective

Minimize the metric `avg executed Toffoli` printed by `cargo run --release`.

### Hard constraints (run is invalid if violated)
1. `=== experiment OK ===` must print. This requires:
   - all 64 classical correctness shots pass, AND
   - `strict_apply` passes — every `R` (i.e. every `assert_zero_and_free`)
     targets a qubit whose 64-shot value is already 0, AND
   - the forward∘reverse identity check passes — after running the
     circuit and then its gate-reversed inverse, every qubit returns to
     its pre-forward snapshot.
2. `qubits` (peak live) must be ≤ **3700** (≈ current baseline).
   Prefer to reduce qubits over time; never exceed the current best's
   qubit count by more than 5% unless the Toffoli win is >10%.
3. `cargo build --release` must succeed with no warnings introduced by your
   edits beyond those already present on the baseline.

### Reversibility

Every ancilla must be uncomputed to |0⟩ before being freed. The standard
pattern is compute / use / uncompute. The harness enforces this two ways:

- `sim.rs` treats every `R` op (`Builder::assert_zero_and_free`) as a hard
  assertion that the target qubit is |0⟩ on every live shot. Dirty frees
  fail at the dirty op with a localized error.
- After the forward pass, the harness zeroes the output registers and
  asserts every remaining qubit is |0⟩. Lingering ancillas anywhere
  outside the four declared registers fail this check.

There are no loopholes — a Toffoli "win" from skipping uncomputation
makes the run fail, not faster.

### Tie-breakers (when Toffoli counts are within ~0.5%)
- Lower peak qubits.
- Lower total Clifford.

## Baseline (honest reversible kaliski, commit `main`)

```
avg executed Toffoli  : 101284162
avg executed Clifford : 211257273
emitted ops           : 383933667
qubits                : 3595
```

Reference targets (zenodo `zkp_ecc` Pareto frontier, for calibration —
these are aspirational, not required):

| Variant | Toffoli | Qubits |
|---|---|---|
| low-qubit | 2,700,000 | 1,175 |
| low-gate  | 2,100,000 | 1,425 |

You are ~40× above these on Toffoli and ~3× over on qubits. There is
substantial room.

## Setup

On first run only:
1. `git checkout -b autoresearch/<YYYY-MM-DD>` — work on a dated branch.
2. Read `src/point_add.rs`, `src/builder.rs`, and the module doc at the top
   of `point_add.rs` (steps 1–12 of the point-add algorithm).
3. Skim `src/circuit.rs` for the `Op` IR and `src/sim.rs` for how gates
   are counted (in particular `sim.rs:102` — `executed_shots` semantics).
4. Verify the baseline runs: `cargo run --release -- --note baseline` should
   print `=== experiment OK ===` and append a TSV row ending in `OK` to
   `results.tsv`.

## Experiment loop

Repeat indefinitely:

1. **Pick an idea**. Either from the seed list below or your own.
2. **Edit** `src/point_add.rs` to implement it.
3. **Build**: `cargo build --release 2>&1 | tail -20`.
   - If it fails to compile, either fix immediately (if the fix is obvious
     and small) or `git checkout -- src/point_add.rs` and pick a different
     idea. Do not leave the tree broken.
4. **Run**: `cargo run --release -- --note "short description of the idea"`
   — `main.rs` automatically appends a TSV row to `results.tsv` with
   timestamp, commit, toffoli, clifford, qubits, ops, correct, and your note.
   Both `OK` and `FAIL` runs log a row.
5. **Decide**: read the last row of `results.tsv` (or the printed metrics).
   - If `correct == OK` AND `toffoli < best_toffoli` AND qubits constraint met:
     - `git add -A && git commit -m "<short desc>: toffoli <old> → <new>"`
     - Update your in-memory `best_toffoli`.
   - Else:
     - `git checkout -- src/point_add.rs` to revert. The TSV row stays;
       it's part of the research log.
6. Go to 1.

Never `git reset --hard` across multiple commits — only revert the current
in-progress edit. Keep every accepted commit.

## results.tsv format

Columns (tab-separated), written automatically by `main.rs`:
```
timestamp    commit    toffoli    clifford    qubits    ops    correct    notes
```
`main.rs` appends one row per `cargo run --release` invocation. The `notes`
column is whatever you pass via `--note "..."`. Tabs and newlines in the
note are stripped. Always pass a note — future-you needs it to interpret
the row.

## Idea seeds

Cheap / local:
- **Eliminate redundant mod-reductions**: our `mod_add_qq` always does
  sub-p + cond-add-p. Many chained adds can defer reduction until the end.
- **Share the `cmod_add_qq` scratch register** across iterations of a
  multiplication instead of alloc/free per iteration.
- **Cuccaro → Draper / QFT adder**: different adder, different Toffoli cost.
- **Replace `mod_neg_inplace` + `mod_add_qq`** in `mod_sub_qq` with a
  direct Cuccaro subtraction (no extra mod_neg round trip).

Medium:
- **Windowed multiplication**: process y in windows of w bits, precomputing
  multiples of x. Cuts the number of conditional adds by a factor of w at
  the cost of a lookup table. See Roetteler et al. 2017 §4.
- **Montgomery-domain arithmetic**: do the whole EC-add in Montgomery form
  so `mod_mul` is cheaper than the schoolbook shift-and-add we use now.
- **Better inverse**: Bernstein–Yang "safegcd" is O(n²) like Kaliski but
  with smaller constants and simpler control flow. Or: skip inverses
  entirely by working in projective (Jacobian) coordinates — but that
  changes the algorithm significantly.

Structural:
- **Fold the two Kaliski calls** in the forward + uncompute halves by
  keeping the inverse in an ancilla register instead of recomputing.
- **Fuse step 5 (`Py -= λ·dx`) with step 3 (`lam += dy/dx`)**: since
  Py ends up zero, there's structure to exploit.
- **Classical conditioning**: many CCX/CCZ in our current code run
  unconditionally. If a CCX's control can be decided classically for a
  given input, wrap it in `push_condition` / `pop_condition` and it stops
  costing Toffolis in `sim.stats`. Look for branches where one side is
  always classical.

Structure research in sweeps: pick one axis (e.g., "replace Kaliski with
safegcd"), implement it, measure, revert or keep. Don't try two ideas at
once — you can't attribute the result.

## Rules of thumb

- If a run takes longer than 5 minutes, something is wrong — kill and revert.
- Cliffords are free compared to Toffolis (~100× cheaper in fault tolerance).
  Do not optimize Cliffords at the cost of Toffolis.
- X/Z gates are not counted at all. Abuse them.
- Correctness is non-negotiable. A 0-Toffoli circuit that fails correctness
  is worth nothing. Run `cargo run --release` after every edit.

## Stop conditions

Keep iterating until one of:
- You hit the zenodo low-qubit target (2.7M Toffoli @ ≤1175 qubits).
- You get stuck: 10 consecutive experiments with no improvement.
  In that case, try a structurally different idea (switch category in the
  seed list). Do not pause for human input.
- The user interrupts.
