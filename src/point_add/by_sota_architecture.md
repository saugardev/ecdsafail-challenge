# BY/compact-DIV SOTA architecture pivot

This is the current non-micro route.  Threshold tuning and local Solinas/Kaliski
polish cannot close a ~1.4M Toffoli gap.  A SOTA-shaped exact affine point-add
has to delete the two current Kaliski-sized inversion objects and replace them
with a compact in-place DIV / product-clean DIV primitive.

## Target architecture

Use a scaled Bernstein–Yang tagged-DIV microprogram instead of Kaliski:

1. Generate a 560-step branch-pattern history for denominator `x` without a
   full 560-bit denominator pair.
2. Decode each 16-bit pattern window into the A-controls.
3. Run the scaled modular microprogram on `(r,s)`:
   - tagged DIV: `(0, y+x) -> (sign(f)*q, 0)` and recover `y/x = sign(f)*q - 1`;
   - inverse/product-clean: `(sign frame q, 0) -> (0, q*x)`.
4. Delete pair1 Kaliski and pair1 schoolbook numerator multiplications; use the
   product-clean inverse shape for pair2 cleanup.

Measured/validated pieces already in the repo:

```text
scaled controlled microstep:      2,046 CCX
560-step replay:                  1,145,760 CCX
pattern+delta decoder:            ~62k CCX for all 35 windows
pattern-history replay peak:      ~1,861q with raw 560-bit pattern history
inverse product-clean replay:     same 1,145,760 CCX in -r frame
```

Budget shape (ignoring selector generation) is therefore in the Google range:

```text
non-inversion affine scaffold after deleting pair1 muls: ~0.64M
one fast BY DIV replay + decode margin:                  ~1.30M
projected fast tagged-DIV point-add:                     ~1.9M-2.3M
low-scratch/vented replay variant:                       ~2.65M
```

So the blocker is no longer the modular replay body.  It is the selector / branch-history generator.

## New selector finding: streaming limb generator

A pure `h = g/f mod 2^16` state is not forward-complete; next-window `h` needs
higher 2-adic denominator data.  A more exact streaming representation is:

```text
(f_j, g_j) = A_j · (p >> 16j, x >> 16j) + c_j
```

where `A_j` is the product of prior 16-step BY matrices and `c_j` is the
low-limb carry.  The test
`streaming_limb_selector_is_exact_but_state_heavy` proves this representation
can generate all 35 branch windows exactly on sampled secp256k1 denominators
without carrying the full denominator pair.

Result:

```text
8 limbs per A/c entry:  fails on all 64 sampled denominators
12 limbs per A/c entry: exact on 64 sampled denominators
state = 4*A entries + 2*c entries = 6 * 12 * 16 = 1152 bits
```

A first structural compression folds the constant `p` column into the carry,
leaving only the two coefficients of the quantum `x` tail plus two carry rows:

```text
16 limbs per folded entry: fails on all 64 sampled denominators
17 limbs per folded entry: exact on 64 sampled denominators
state = 2*b_x entries + 2*c entries = 4 * 17 * 16 = 1088 bits
```

This is constructive but not yet SOTA-shaped.  It replaces a full 560-bit
2-adic denominator pair with a selector state, and the constant-column fold
shows the state can move in the right direction, but 1088 selector bits is still
too large for the ~600 extra-qubit target.

The folded entries do not need equal widths.  The x-column coefficients only
need 9 limbs, while the carry rows need 17 and 16 limbs:

```text
separate-width folded state = (2*9 + 17 + 16) * 16 = 816 bits
8-limb x-column fails; 15-limb second carry fails
```

Even better, after 16 windows all 256 bits of `x` have been consumed.  From
then on the x-column coefficients no longer affect branch selection and only
the carry core is live:

```text
post-tail carry core = (17 + 16) * 16 = 528 bits
pre-tail x-column workspace = 2 * 9 * 16 = 288 bits
```

This is the first selector subproblem that is actually inside the ~600-bit
scratch target: windows 16..34 can be driven by a 528-bit carry core.

For the early `x`-dependent part, storing all first-16 raw patterns would cost
256 bits.  Empirically the per-window fixed code is smaller:

```text
first16 pattern history entropy H ≈ 195.4 bits
fixed per-window pattern IDs     = 208 bits
carry core + fixed first16 IDs   = 736 bits
```

This is low-gate-shaped (`512 data + 736 selector ≈ 1248q`, before arithmetic
scratch and assuming b-workspace is recomputed/borrowed), but not low-qubit
1175-shaped (`736 > 663` extra-qubit allowance).  It says an exact
Google-low-gate-ish selector may be reachable with compressed first16 history;
Google-low-qubit still needs either less carry state or no persistent early
history.

Caveat: the 9-limb x-column is a **residue scratch**, not an in-place reversible
state.  `truncated_x_column_selector_state_is_not_locally_reversible` records
the simple obstruction: even the C-branch update `b0 <- 2*b0 (mod 2^144)` is
two-to-one.  Therefore the x-column must be recomputed from retained pattern
history, kept at a wider exact width, or cleaned by a nontrivial MBUC phase
method.  Do not wire the 816-bit model as a rolling register.

## Compact denominator-pair history sink

The full-ratio path below solved state but exposed a gate blocker in the A-step
inverse.  A better state/gate compromise is to keep the ordinary 256-bit BY
integer denominator pair `(f,g)` and store consumed raw branch bits in the high
zero slack that appears as the pair shrinks.

`denominator_pair_plus_50_sidecar_can_hold_raw_history_on_samples` and
`denominator_pair_fixed_slack_schedule_50_sidecar_on_samples` check 8192 sampled
secp256k1 denominators over the 560-step schedule:

```text
adaptive per-trace max convergence observed = 558
adaptive worst raw-history deficit          = 49 bits
fixed per-step slack schedule worst deficit = 50 bits
```

So a `512-bit` magnitude pair plus a `50-bit` sidecar can carry all raw branch
history in the sampled traces, even with a fixed schedule based on per-step
worst observed bitlengths.  With two sign bits this is roughly
`512 + 2 + 50 = 564` selector/history bits, inside the low-qubit ~600-bit target
and with only linear shift/add divstep updates (no ratio inverse).  This is now
the most promising selector architecture.

Open implementation questions:

1. Prove or enforce the 49-bit deficit bound for all nonzero secp256k1 inputs
   under the fixed 560-step schedule.
2. Design the reversible allocator/compactor that moves history bits between
   the sidecar and pair high-zero slack as `bitlen(f)+bitlen(g)` changes.
3. Couple the recovered/stored raw branch bits to the scaled modular replay and
   reverse the pair/history sink cleanly.

## Full ratio selector compression

A stronger route eliminates the x-column/carry split entirely.  BY branch
choices depend only on `delta` and the 2-adic ratio

```text
h = g/f.
```

For the denominator pair `(f,g)=(p,x)`, initialize

```text
h0 = x * p^-1 mod 2^560
```

and update `h` directly.  The closed ratio rules are:

```text
C (g even):        h' = h/2,              delta' = delta + 1
B (g odd, δ <= 0): h' = (h + 1)/2,        delta' = delta + 1
A (g odd, δ > 0):  h' = (h - 1)/(2h),     delta' = 1 - delta
```

The active width drops by one bit per divstep, so a fixed 560-qubit register can
hold both the remaining ratio and the consumed branch history in its vacated
bits.  `full_ratio_state_streams_all_branches_in_560_bits` validates this on 64
sampled denominators: the 560-bit ratio stream exactly matches all BY branch
bits and tapers to zero.

Selector information budget:

```text
full ratio/history selector = 560 bits
low-qubit allowance target  ≈ 600 bits
```

This is the first selector architecture that is genuinely 1175q-shaped in
state, without first16 carry rows, 288-bit x-column residues, or separate tail
history.  The next blocker is circuit cost for:

1. computing/uncomputing `h0 = x * p^-1 mod 2^560`, and
2. implementing the A-step ratio update `(h - 1)/(2h)` reversibly without a
   per-step variable inverse blow-up.

`full_ratio_initial_constant_multiply_is_not_the_main_blocker` suggests item 1
is acceptable: a naive shifted controlled-add constant multiply has summed add
width 110,720, so a compute+uncompute round trip is roughly 221k--443k Toffoli
under 1--2 Toffoli/bit add assumptions (`p^-1` has popcount 305 over 560 bits).

`ratio_a_step_is_inverse_dense_and_common` records why item 2 is serious:
for a toy 16-bit odd `h`, one high output bit of the A map has ANF degree 14 and
7268 nonzero monomials out of 32768; real 560-step traces average about 132 A
steps (max 149 over 64 samples).  Therefore the full-ratio selector is
state-optimal but not yet gate-optimal; a naive per-A modular inverse is dead.
`ratio_a_step_serial_inverse_budget_is_too_large` also kills the obvious
low-scratch serial inverse: summing `t^2/2` over real A-step positions gives a
mean proxy of about 7.31M operations (max 8.89M) before cleanup.
The next architectural question is whether to implement the ratio stream with a
windowed/Möbius method, a cheap inverse-maintenance invariant, or fall back to a
larger linear carry state.  A first windowed check,
`ratio_window_mobius_denominators_are_not_near_constant`, found that 16-step
Möbius denominators have even `m01`, but not enough 2-adic valuation to be
nearly constant:

```text
v2(m01) histogram over 2240 windows:
[0, 347, 673, 380, 317, 164, 104, 55, 49, 17, 18, 2, 2, 9, 9, 2, 92]
```

So a geometric-series inverse gets some help (`v2>=1` always) but not enough for
a free update: 45.5% of 16-bit windows have only `v2=1` or `2`.
`wider_ratio_windows_do_not_remove_mobius_inverse_problem` repeats the check for
32-bit windows; 822/1088 sampled windows still have `v2(m01)<=4`.  Simply
increasing the window size does not remove the variable-inverse problem.

The 304-bit tail-ratio result remains useful as a fallback/diagnostic: after 16
windows, `h=g/f mod 2^304` streams the remaining 304 branch bits exactly.

A tempting projective normalization sets the folded carry `c0=1`, because BY
branch choices are invariant under a common odd scale.  That would reduce the
selector to three entries:

```text
projective normalized state = 3 * 17 * 16 = 816 bits
```

but `projective_normalized_streaming_selector_loses_high_bits` fails on all 64
sampled denominators.  Repeated normalization discards high 2-adic information
needed by later windows.  This kills the simplest 816-bit state.

## Next architecture work

Do not spend more time on local Kaliski thresholds.  The next useful work is to
compress or avoid the `A_j` state:

- Recompute `A_j mod 2^k` reversibly from compressed pattern history only when a
  window needs it, then uncompute it before modular replay.
- Factor `A_j` using the already-observed small Hermite/unimodular window
  structure so the live selector state is `O(2 rows + carry)` instead of four
  12-limb matrix entries.
- Try entropy-coded matrix/pattern history as the persistent object, with a
  small rolling carry sidecar; target is `<480` history bits + `<150` selector
  scratch.
- If those fail, the scaled BY route is Toffoli-viable but not low-qubit viable;
  pivot to a compact Montgomery/windowed DIV core rather than returning to
  current Kaliski polishing.
