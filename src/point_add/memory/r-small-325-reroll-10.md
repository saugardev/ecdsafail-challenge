# R-small 325 with reroll 10

State slice: `src/point_add/kaliski_state.rs` R-small threshold and
`src/point_add/mod.rs` Fiat-Shamir reroll default.

The current C* stack (`KAL_DIALOG_FOLD=1`, `AFFINE_SQUARE_RECOMPUTE=1`,
`KAL_GZ_EARLY_RECOVER=1`, `KAL_WTRUNC_K0=20`, margin 0, carry-tail W=19)
validates with `R_SMALL_THRESHOLD=325` when the free reroll is `KAL_REROLL=10`.

Validation:

```bash
KAL_R_SMALL_THRESHOLD=325 KAL_REROLL=10 ./benchmark.sh --note "candidate R_SMALL_THRESHOLD=325 KAL_REROLL=10 full validation"
```

Result: 0 classical mismatches, 0 phase-garbage batches, 0 ancilla-garbage
batches over 9024 shots. Metrics were 2,559,671 average executed Toffoli, 2025
qubits, score 5,183,333,775.

Negative evidence: `R_SMALL_THRESHOLD=326` passed 512-shot screening for many
rerolls but failed full validation. `rr=0` failed official benchmark with 7
classical mismatches and 4 phase-garbage batches. A full-shot screen over
rerolls 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,14,15,16,17,18,19,22,23,25 found no clean island.
